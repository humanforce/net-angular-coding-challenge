# Planning App Backend

This is the backend project that contains and serves the ClientApp.

Running this project alone will serve the complete webapp.

## Development server

Launch the server:
1. Go to this directory
2. Run "dotnet watch run"
3. Open url "https://localhost:44448" in a browser (automatic).

Alternatively, launch the frontend codes in a separated command window (after launching the server from the previous steps):
1. Go to the ClientApp directory "cd ./ClientApp"
2. Run "ng serve"
3. Open url "http://localhost:4200" in a browser.

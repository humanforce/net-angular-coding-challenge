# Planning App Frontend

This is the frontend component of the app. Launch backend server first.

## Development server

Launch the server in the parent folder:
1. Go to the parent project directory "cd ../Planning"
2. Run "dotnet watch run"
3. Open url "https://localhost:44448" in a browser (automatic).

Alternatively, launch the frontend codes in a separated command window (after launching the server from the previous steps):
1. Go to this directory
2. Run "ng serve"
3. Open url "http://localhost:4200" in a browser.
